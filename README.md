# List-of-temporary-and-disposable-email-domains
[02-01-2017] Here is a list of 2861 domains for disposable and temporary email addresses and another list that covers 2748 fake email providers. I did not cross check both of these excel files for duplicates.


Useful for filtering your email list to increase open rates (sending email to these domains likely will not be opened).
